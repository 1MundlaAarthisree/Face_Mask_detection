# Face_Mask_detection

To build a real-time vision based automatic door entry system that allows a person to enter only if he/she is wearing a mask.
Since the system has to be real time, there are 3 modules to this problem:

● Identifying the person - human detection

● Identifying region of interest of the face - face detection

● Identifying the presence of a mask

Algorithms like R-CNN and YOLO are used for human detection.

For face detection, there are several algorithms like Viola Jones,Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (|HoG).

For the mask detection problem we have used convolutional neural networks.
