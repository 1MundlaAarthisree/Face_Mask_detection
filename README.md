# Face_Mask_detection
To build a real-time vision based automatic door entry system that allows a person
to enter only if he/she is wearing a mask.
Since the system has to be real time, there are 3 modules to this problem:
● Identifying the person - human detection
● Identifying region of interest of the face - face detection
● Identifying the presence of a mask
